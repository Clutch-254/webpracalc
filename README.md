# Bethwel's Futuristic Calculator

## Project Overview
This is a sleek, modern calculator web application with a futuristic design aesthetic. The calculator provides all standard arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) with a responsive user interface that works across devices.

## Features
- Futuristic UI with gradient effects and subtle animations
- Full arithmetic functionality
- Responsive design that works on mobile and desktop
- Keyboard support for faster input
- Touch gesture support (swipe left to delete)
- Error handling for division by zero

## Technical Implementation
I decided to combine the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into a single file for this project. This decision was made because:

1. The HTML structure is relatively simple and compact
2. Having everything in one file makes it more convenient to deploy and share
3. It eliminates the need to link external files, making loading faster
4. This approach simplifies the development workflow for small applications

## How to Use
1. Simply open the HTML file in any modern web browser
2. Use mouse clicks or touch to operate the calculator
3. Keyboard input is supported for numbers, operators, and control functions
4. Swipe left on mobile devices to delete the last character

## Acknowledgments
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to CODSOFT for providing this internship opportunity. This project was completed as part of the CODSOFT internship program, which has been instrumental in allowing me to apply and enhance my web development skills.
